The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentage values in some browsers. For example, the following code snippet might not produce the expected result:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

In some browsers, this may result in the element having a width of 0 or a different unexpected value. This is because some older browsers might not correctly calculate the value when percentages and pixels are used together in `calc()`.
